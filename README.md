# School_District_Analysis
##Overview of the school district analysis

1.	The purpose of this analysis is to prepare all funding and standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insight about performance trends and patterns. These insight from the reports created will be useful in making strategic decisions at the school and district levels. With this analysis we can aggregate data from two data sheets and showcase trends in school performance and budget allocation. This analysis considers the academic dishonesty regarding the math and reading grades of 9th grade students in Thomas high school and thus excludes the grades of involved students from this analysis.
